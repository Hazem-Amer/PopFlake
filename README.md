## Architecture

Popflake is built using the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture pattern, following clean architecture principles. This ensures a scalable, maintainable, and testable codebase.

### Key Components:

- **ViewModel**: Manages UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way, allowing data to survive configuration changes.
- **Use Cases**: Encapsulate business logic, making it easy to test and maintain.
- **Repository**: Acts as a mediator between different data sources, ensuring a single source of truth.

## Technologies and Libraries

- **[Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/)**: For seamless API calls and integrating external services.
- **[Shimmer Layout](https://facebook.github.io/shimmer-android/)**: Provides smooth loading indicators, enhancing user experience.
- **[Room Database](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/room)**: Manages local data persistence, ensuring offline access.
- **[Hilt Dagger](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android)**: Simplifies dependency injection and improves code organization.
- **[Picasso](https://square.github.io/picasso/)**: Efficiently loads and displays movie posters.
